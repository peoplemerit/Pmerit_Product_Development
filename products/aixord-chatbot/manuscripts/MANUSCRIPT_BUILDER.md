## Preface

You're a builder. Maybe you're a freelancer working with different clients. Maybe you're a consultant bringing AI governance to organizations. Maybe you're a developer who uses multiple AI platforms depending on the task.

You need flexibility without losing structure.

The AIXORD Builder's Toolkit gives you exactly that: core variants that work anywhere, templates you can customize, and strategies for multi-platform workflows. This isn't about one AI tool—it's about working effectively with all of them.

Keep building. Stay disciplined.

# PART 1: FOUNDATION

---

## Chapter 1: Introduction to AIXORD

### What is AIXORD?

AIXORD (AI Execution Order) is a governance framework for AI collaboration. It provides:

- **Clear authority** — You decide WHAT, AI decides HOW
- **Explicit modes** — Either discussing OR implementing
- **Written records** — If it's not documented, it doesn't exist

### The System Equation

```
MASTER_SCOPE = Project_Docs = All_SCOPEs = Production-Ready System
```

Documents ARE the system. This equation holds regardless of which AI platform you use.

### Why a Toolkit?

Different situations call for different tools:

| Situation | Best Approach |
|-----------|---------------|
| New idea, unclear scope | Genesis variant |
| Any AI, simple governance | Universal variant |
| Long sessions, token limits | Enhanced variant |
| Complex project | Full SCOPE system |

The Builder's Toolkit gives you all of these.

---

## Chapter 2: The Authority Model

### The Two Authorities

**Decision Authority** — Always held by you (the human).

**Execution Authority** — Delegated to AI during EXECUTION mode.

### The Authority Contract

| Role | Can Do | Cannot Do |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Human (Director) | Decide, approve, override | Micromanage HOW |
| AI (Architect) | Recommend, specify | Execute, decide |
| AI (Commander) | Implement, report | Change requirements |

This contract applies to ALL AI platforms.

---

## Chapter 3: Mode Discipline

### DECISION Mode

Open exploration and specification.

- Brainstorm freely
- Document decisions
- AI acts as Architect

### EXECUTION Mode

Frozen decisions, implementation only.

- Follow specs exactly
- AI acts as Commander
- No new features

### AUDIT Mode

Read-only verification.

- Compare reality to docs
- Find gaps
- No modifications

### The Universal Rule

These modes work identically across all AI platforms. The commands are the same. The discipline is the same.

---

## Chapter 4: HALT Conditions

### Automatic Triggers

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Ambiguous requirement | Stop, ask |
| Missing specification | Stop, request |
| Prerequisite not met | Stop, report |
| Three consecutive failures | Stop, escalate |

### HALT Protocol

1. Stop all work
2. Document issue
3. Report to human
4. Wait for direction

This protocol is platform-independent.

---

## Chapter 5: Session Continuity

### The HANDOFF

At session end, AI generates a structured summary containing:
- Current mode
- Active scope
- Decisions made
- Work completed
- Work pending
- Next priorities

### Session Protocol

**Ending:** Say `HANDOFF`, save output.

**Starting:** Paste HANDOFF, say `CONTINUE`.

This works on Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any other AI.

---

# PART 2: THE VARIANTS

---

## Chapter 6: The Genesis Variant — From Idea to System

### When to Use Genesis

Use Genesis when:
- Starting from an idea (not a detailed plan)
- Working solo on a new project
- You want the project to evolve naturally

### The Genesis Philosophy

**Start simple. Let complexity emerge.**

Genesis keeps everything in one document until you need more structure. The project tells you when to decompose.

### How Genesis Works

**Session 1:** Idea + governance → Initial decisions

**Session 2-N:** HANDOFF + discussion → More decisions, research

**Session N+1:** Project grows → Decompose into SCOPEs

**Session N+M:** SCOPEs complete → Production system

### Token Tracking

Genesis includes automatic token tracking:

| Threshold | Alert |
|-----------|-------|
| 70% | Warning — plan for handoff |
| 80% | Alert — recommend handoff now |
| 85% | Auto-generate handoff |

### The Metamorphosis Pattern

```
IDEA → DECISIONS → RESEARCH → SPECS → IMPLEMENTATION → SYSTEM
```

Each stage transforms into the next naturally.

### Genesis Example

```
Session 1:
"I want to build a personal finance tracker"
→ 5 decisions made, basic structure

Session 3:
→ Research complete, ready to spec

Session 5:
→ Specifications written

Session 10:
→ Project is complex enough, split into:
   - SCOPE_ACCOUNTS
   - SCOPE_TRANSACTIONS
   - SCOPE_REPORTS

Session 15:
→ All scopes complete
→ Production system
```

## Chapter 7: The Universal Variant — Any Platform

### When to Use Universal

Use Universal when:
- Working with any AI platform
- Need simple, portable governance
- Don't need token tracking
- Standard complexity projects

### What's Included

The Universal variant provides:
- Authority contract
- Mode commands
- HALT conditions
- HANDOFF format
- Session protocol

No platform-specific features. Works everywhere.

### Setup Pattern

1. Copy Universal governance text
2. Paste at start of any AI session
3. AI acknowledges
4. Begin work

### Portability

The same governance text works on:
- Claude (all tiers)
- ChatGPT (all tiers)
- Gemini (all tiers)
- Copilot Chat
- Any conversational AI

### Universal Limitations

- No token tracking
- No platform optimizations
- Manual session management

For these features, use the Enhanced variant.

---

## Chapter 8: The Enhanced Variant — Token Tracking

### When to Use Enhanced

Use Enhanced when:
- Sessions run long
- Complex discussions
- Need automatic handoff triggers
- Working across multiple sessions

### Token Tracking Explained

AI has limited context windows. Enhanced tracks usage:

```
[TOKEN STATUS: 72% - Plan for handoff soon]
[TOKEN STATUS: 81% - Recommend handoff now]
[TOKEN STATUS: 86% - Auto-generating handoff]
```

### Proactive Handoffs

At thresholds, AI:
1. Announces status
2. Recommends action
3. Auto-generates handoff if critical

You never lose work to context overflow.

### Enhanced Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Token tracking | Monitors context usage |
| Proactive alerts | Warns before overflow |
| Auto-handoff | Generates summary at threshold |
| State indicators | Shows mode/scope in responses |

### Enhanced vs Universal

| Feature | Universal | Enhanced |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Works anywhere | Yes | Yes |
| Token tracking | No | Yes |
| Auto-handoff | No | Yes |
| Complexity | Low | Medium |

Choose based on your needs.

# PART 3: TEMPLATES

## Chapter 9: SCOPE Templates — Breaking Down Projects

### What is a SCOPE?

A SCOPE is a single, implementable unit of work. When your project gets complex, you decompose it into SCOPEs.

### SCOPE Lifecycle

```
EMPTY → AUDITED → SPECIFIED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE → LOCKED
```

### SCOPE Template Structure

```markdown
# SCOPE: [Name]

## Status: [EMPTY/AUDITED/SPECIFIED/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETE/LOCKED]

## Dependencies
- [List required scopes that must be complete]

## Decision Log
| ID | Decision | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| D-001 | [decision] | [APPROVED/REJECTED/PENDING] |

## Requirements
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

## Specifications
[Detailed specifications for implementation]

## Implementation Notes
[Technical notes, patterns, constraints]

## Audit Report
[Reality check findings when audited]

## Handoff
[Current session state]
```

### Using SCOPE Templates

1. Create SCOPE when project grows complex
2. Fill in status (start at EMPTY)
3. Audit reality → AUDITED
4. Write specs → SPECIFIED
5. Implement → IN_PROGRESS
6. Verify → COMPLETE
7. Protect → LOCKED

### SCOPE Naming Convention

```
SCOPE_AUTH      (authentication)
SCOPE_UI        (user interface)
SCOPE_API       (API endpoints)
SCOPE_DATA      (data layer)
SCOPE_REPORTS   (reporting)
```

Use descriptive, short names.

## Chapter 10: MASTER_SCOPE — The Big Picture

### What is MASTER_SCOPE?

MASTER_SCOPE is your project's north star—the overall vision that all SCOPEs serve.

### MASTER_SCOPE Template

```markdown
# MASTER_SCOPE: [Project Name]

## Vision
[One paragraph describing what this project is and why it exists]

## Goals
1. [Primary goal]
2. [Secondary goal]
3. [Tertiary goal]

## Constraints
- [Budget/time/resource constraints]
- [Technical constraints]
- [Business constraints]

## SCOPEs
| Scope | Status | Dependencies |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| SCOPE_AUTH | SPECIFIED | None |
| SCOPE_API | IN_PROGRESS | SCOPE_AUTH |
| SCOPE_UI | EMPTY | SCOPE_API |

## Timeline (if applicable)
| Milestone | Date | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| MVP | [date] | [status] |

## Stakeholders
| Role | Person |
|------|--------|
| Director | [You] |
| [Other roles] | [Names] |

## Change Log
| Date | Change | Approved By |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [date] | [change] | [name] |
```

### MASTER_SCOPE Usage

- Create at project start (can be minimal)
- Update as SCOPEs are created
- Reference when making scope decisions
- Share with stakeholders

### The Relationship

```
MASTER_SCOPE
├── SCOPE_AUTH
├── SCOPE_API
├── SCOPE_UI
└── SCOPE_DATA
```

MASTER_SCOPE owns all SCOPEs. SCOPEs implement MASTER_SCOPE's vision.

## Chapter 11: HANDOFF Templates — Session Transitions

### Basic HANDOFF Template

```markdown
# HANDOFF — [Project] Session [N]

## State
- Mode: [DECISION/EXECUTION]
- Active Scope: [name or "Project-level"]
- Date: [date]
- Token Status: [if using Enhanced]

## Decisions Made This Session
| ID | Decision | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| D-XXX | [decision] | [APPROVED/PENDING] |

## Completed This Session
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

## Pending
- [Item 3]
- [Item 4]

## Blockers
- [Any blockers, or "None"]

## Next Session Priority
1. [First thing to do]
2. [Second thing]
3. [Third thing]

## Notes
[Any context for next session]
```

### When to Generate HANDOFF

- End of every session
- Before token threshold
- When switching contexts
- Before taking a break

### HANDOFF Best Practices

1. **Always save locally** — Don't trust chat history
2. **Use consistent naming** — HANDOFF_001.md, HANDOFF_002.md
3. **Don't edit old handoffs** — They're historical records
4. **Include enough context** — Next session should understand immediately

---

## Chapter 12: Customizing Templates for Your Workflow

### Template Customization Principles

Templates are starting points. Customize them for your needs:

1. **Add fields you use** — Client name, billing code, etc.
2. **Remove fields you don't** — Simpler is better
3. **Match your terminology** — Use words your team knows
4. **Keep core structure** — Mode, decisions, handoffs

### Client-Specific Templates

If you work with multiple clients:

```markdown
# HANDOFF — [Client] / [Project] Session [N]

## Client Context
- Client: [name]
- Contract: [reference]
- Contact: [person]

[Rest of standard HANDOFF]
```

### Team Templates

For team collaboration:

```markdown
# SCOPE: [Name]

## Ownership
- Owner: [person]
- Reviewers: [people]
- Approver: [person]

[Rest of standard SCOPE]
```

### Tooling Integration

Integrate templates with your tools:

| Tool | Integration |
|------|-------------|
| Notion | SCOPE as database entries |
| GitHub | SCOPE as issue templates |
| Jira | HANDOFF as ticket comments |
| Google Docs | Templates as shared docs |

### Version Your Templates

Keep templates in version control:

```
/templates/
├── SCOPE_TEMPLATE_v2.md
├── HANDOFF_TEMPLATE_v2.md
├── MASTER_SCOPE_TEMPLATE_v1.md
└── CLIENT_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE_v1.md
```

Update version numbers when you change templates.
