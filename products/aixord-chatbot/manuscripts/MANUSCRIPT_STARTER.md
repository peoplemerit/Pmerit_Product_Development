## Chapter 1: What is AIXORD?

### The Problem

Have you ever had a great conversation with AI, started a project, and then returned the next day to find the AI has forgotten everything?

Have you experienced that frustration when AI "just does something" you never approved?

Have you abandoned projects because the AI kept going in circles?

You're not alone. These are the three biggest reasons AI projects fail.

### The Solution

AIXORD (AI Execution Order) is a simple framework that fixes these problems. It's inspired by how military operations work—clear authority, explicit modes, documented decisions.

You don't need to be technical. You don't need special tools. AIXORD works with any AI chatbot you already use.

### How It Works

AIXORD has three core principles:

1. **Clear Authority** — You decide WHAT. AI decides HOW.
2. **Explicit Modes** — Either discussing OR implementing. Never both.
3. **Written Records** — If it's not documented, it doesn't exist.

That's it. Master these three principles and your AI projects will succeed.

## Chapter 2: The Authority Model (Basics)

### Who's in Charge?

In AIXORD, authority is always clear:

**You (the Human) are the Director.**
- You decide what to build
- You approve plans before execution
- You resolve any confusion

**AI is your Assistant.**
- AI suggests options
- AI implements your decisions
- AI asks for help when stuck

### The Golden Rule

**AI cannot make decisions. Only you can.**

When AI proposes something, that's a suggestion. It becomes a decision only when you say "APPROVED."

This simple rule eliminates most AI project failures.

### Example

**Without AIXORD:**
> You: Let's build an app
> AI: Great! I'll use React with TypeScript and add authentication...
> (AI made three decisions you never approved)

**With AIXORD:**
> You: Let's build an app
> AI: What kind of app? What features do you need?
> You: A todo app, simple
> AI: I propose: Basic todo list, no login required. APPROVED?
> You: APPROVED
> AI: Decision logged. Ready when you are.

See the difference? Every decision is explicit.

## Chapter 3: Your Three Modes

### Mode 1: DECISION Mode

This is discussion mode. You and AI are figuring things out.

- Brainstorm freely
- Explore options
- Nothing is final until documented
- AI suggests, you decide

**How to enter:** Say `ENTER DECISION MODE` (or it's the default)

### Mode 2: EXECUTION Mode

This is implementation mode. Decisions are frozen. AI follows your approved plan.

- No new features
- No changing direction
- AI implements exactly what was specified
- You verify, AI executes

**How to enter:** Say `ENTER EXECUTION MODE`

### Mode 3: AUDIT Mode

This is review mode. Look at what exists without changing anything.

- Read-only
- Compare reality to plans
- Find gaps
- No modifications

**How to enter:** Say `AUDIT`

### The Key Rule

**Never mix modes.** You're either deciding OR executing. If you need to change something during execution, first return to DECISION mode.

## Chapter 4: When to HALT

### What is HALT?

HALT is the safety valve. When something's wrong, everything stops. This is good—it catches problems early.

### When AI Should HALT

| Situation | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| Unclear requirement | AI stops and asks for clarification |
| Missing information | AI stops and requests what's needed |
| Something unexpected | AI stops and reports the issue |
| AI is unsure | AI stops rather than guessing |

### When You Should HALT

Say `HALT` whenever:
- AI is going in the wrong direction
- You need to think about something
- You realize a decision was wrong
- You're confused

### HALT is Not Failure

New users resist HALT because it feels like interruption. Experienced users love it. Every HALT is a problem caught before it gets worse.

---

## Chapter 5: Keeping Context Across Sessions

### The Problem

AI has no memory. Each session starts fresh. This kills projects.

### The Solution: HANDOFFs

At the end of every session, AI creates a HANDOFF—a summary of everything important.

Next session, you paste the HANDOFF. AI picks up right where you left off.

### What's in a HANDOFF?

```
HANDOFF — My Project, Session 3

State:
- Mode: DECISION
- Date: 2025-01-15

Decisions Made:
| Decision | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Use simple file storage | APPROVED |
| No login required | APPROVED |

Completed:
- Basic layout designed
- Data structure decided

Next Steps:
1. Build the main screen
2. Add save functionality
```

### The HANDOFF Habit

**End of every session:** Say `HANDOFF`, then save what AI generates.

**Start of every session:** Paste your saved HANDOFF and say `CONTINUE`.

This simple habit preserves your project context forever.

## Chapter 6: Your First AIXORD Session

### Step 1: Start the Conversation

Copy and paste this into any AI chatbot:

```
You are operating under AIXORD governance.

Authority:
- I am the Director. I decide WHAT we build.
- You are my Assistant. You suggest HOW to build it.
- Nothing happens without my explicit approval.

Modes:
- DECISION MODE: We discuss and plan. You suggest, I approve.
- EXECUTION MODE: Plans are frozen. You implement exactly what was approved.

Rules:
- When unsure, ask me
- Document all decisions
- Say HALT if anything is unclear

Acknowledge these rules, then ask what I want to build.
```

### Step 2: Describe Your Project

After AI acknowledges, tell it what you want:

> I want to create a simple personal budget tracker.

### Step 3: Answer AI's Questions

AI will ask clarifying questions. Answer honestly. Say "I don't know" if you're unsure—that's useful information.

### Step 4: Approve Decisions

When AI proposes something, either:
- Say `APPROVED` to accept
- Say `NO` and explain what you want instead
- Say `CLARIFY` if you need more information

### Step 5: End with HANDOFF

Before closing the session, say:

> HANDOFF

AI will generate a summary. Copy it and save it somewhere (a note app, a text file, anywhere).

### Step 6: Next Session

When you return, start with:

> CONTINUE
> [Paste your saved HANDOFF here]

AI will pick up exactly where you left off.

## Chapter 7: Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Skipping the Governance Paste

**Problem:** AI doesn't follow AIXORD rules.

**Fix:** Always paste the governance block at the start of new sessions.

### Mistake 2: Not Saving HANDOFFs

**Problem:** You lose context between sessions.

**Fix:** Make it a habit. Session ends = save HANDOFF. No exceptions.

### Mistake 3: Mixing Decide and Execute

**Problem:** Chaos. Changing direction mid-implementation.

**Fix:** Stay in one mode. If you need to change something during execution, say HALT first, then ENTER DECISION MODE.

### Mistake 4: Saying "Sure" Instead of "APPROVED"

**Problem:** AI isn't sure if you're really approving.

**Fix:** Be explicit. Say `APPROVED` or `YES, PROCEED`. Clear language = clear outcomes.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring HALT

**Problem:** Building on shaky foundations.

**Fix:** Embrace HALT. It's saving you from bigger problems later.

### Mistake 6: Over-Complicating Early

**Problem:** Trying to use advanced features on day one.

**Fix:** Start simple. Use only DECISION mode and EXECUTION mode. Add complexity as you grow.
