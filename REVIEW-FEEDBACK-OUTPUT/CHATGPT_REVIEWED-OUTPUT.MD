PHASE 1 OBJECTIVE



Verify Amazon KDP compliance before any structural, content, or marketing evaluation.



🔍 COMPLIANCE CHECK RESULTS

1\. Plagiarism \& Originality



Status: ✅ PASS



Content is original, methodology-driven, and internally consistent.



Military OPORD inspiration is clearly transformative and not derivative.



No verbatim reuse of copyrighted doctrine or manuals.



2\. AI Disclosure \& Authorship



Status: ⚠️ ISSUE (Minor – Fix Required)



The book discusses AI extensively and positions AI as issuing “orders.”



However, there is no explicit AI usage disclosure statement clarifying:



Whether AI assisted in drafting, editing, or structuring the manuscript.



📌 KDP Requirement:

If AI was used in any part of creation, disclosure is recommended (and increasingly enforced).



Required Fix (Suggested Location):



Add a short AI Usage Disclosure in either:



Copyright page, or



About the Author section



Suggested Language (Example):



This book was developed with the assistance of AI tools used for drafting, iteration, and refinement. All final decisions, structure, and intellectual ownership remain with the author.



3\. Misleading Claims / Guarantees



Status: ✅ PASS



No false promises (e.g., “guaranteed results,” “certified outcomes”).



Tiered Consent Model appropriately limits liability-sensitive domains.



Claims are framed as methodology, not professional advice.



4\. Prohibited or Restricted Content



Status: ✅ PASS



No hate, violence, illegal activity, or sexual content.



Military references are conceptual and instructional only.



“Fool Filter” language is philosophical, not abusive.



5\. Trademark \& Brand Usage



Status: ⚠️ ISSUE (Low Risk – Clarification Recommended)



Mentions of Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.



These are descriptive and comparative (allowed under nominative fair use).



📌 Recommendation (Not Mandatory):

Add a short disclaimer:



All third-party product names and trademarks are the property of their respective owners and are used for identification purposes only.



6\. Minimum Content Length

The progression is exceptionally clear:



Problem definition

Templates and commands



Example workflow



Risk \& consent framework



Variants and extensions



This mirrors how a practitioner actually learns and applies the system, which is ideal for instructional nonfiction.

No orphaned sections or dead-end chapters.

Helps reduce negative reviews from mismatched readers.
