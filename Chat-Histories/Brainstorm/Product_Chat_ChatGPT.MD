Let's refine the manuscript with AIXORD idea in this file.
I have designed the manuscript specifically for the Pro Claude model, where users have access to the instruction area and their computer/folder directory systems linked to Claude Code... I would like to adapt it for CHATGPT and GEMINI as well, their simple free or non-standard users access, like chabot. What are the likely possibilities of these ideas?

Let's treat this session as brainstorm... I have used a similar system with a simple chatbot. See the file for the format. I just fed the chatbot through file input. That established the context and expectations. The model being used tracked the estimated tokens and produced an updated handoff within the same file for continuation. All tasks completed are marked completed, etc..
How many product variations are we talking about... I need to roll these out ASAP.
I provided you with Access to the GitHub repo of Pmerit. I have Repo for AI powerd Platfor and a repo for product design and development for the platform. Can you review the Repo for product design and development
I also have an idea to flip YouTube DIY into something like text and visually appealing for people to buy, rather than videos.
Now how many product line now?
