## Preface

You have an idea. Maybe it's written on a napkin. Maybe it's been living in your head for months. You know what you want to build, but the path from idea to reality feels overwhelming.

AIXORD Genesis is designed for exactly this situation. It's a specialized variant of the AIXORD framework that lets you start with nothing but an idea and evolve it—session by session—into a complete, documented system.

No upfront architecture. No massive planning documents. Just you, your AI assistant, and a structured conversation that grows into something real.

Keep building. Stay disciplined.

# PART 1: FOUNDATION

---

## Chapter 1: The Genesis Philosophy

### The Problem with Planning

Traditional project management says: plan everything first, then build.

But for solo creators and entrepreneurs, this approach fails because:

- You don't know enough to plan completely
- Requirements change as you learn
- Detailed upfront planning kills momentum
- You're not managing a team—you're building

### The Genesis Alternative

Genesis inverts the traditional approach:

**Start with an idea. Let the project tell you what it needs.**

Instead of planning everything upfront, you:

1. Begin with a single document
2. Have structured conversations with AI
3. Let complexity emerge naturally
4. Decompose only when necessary

This is the **metamorphosis pattern**: your idea transforms through stages until it becomes a production-ready system.

### Why This Works

Genesis works because:

- Every project starts simple, even complex ones
- AI excels at structured evolution
- Documentation is created as you go
- You maintain momentum from day one

### The Single Truth

In Genesis, one document holds everything: your decisions, your research, your specifications, your handoffs. This document IS your project until it grows big enough to split.

---

## Chapter 2: The Authority Model

### Your Role: The Director

You are the Director. This means:

- You decide WHAT exists
- You approve all specifications
- You resolve ambiguity
- AI cannot override you

### AI's Role: Architect and Commander

AI plays two roles depending on mode:

**Architect (DECISION mode):**
- Asks clarifying questions
- Proposes solutions
- Writes specifications
- Documents decisions

**Commander (EXECUTION mode):**
- Implements specifications
- Follows the plan exactly
- Reports progress
- Requests clarification

### The Authority Contract

Every Genesis session begins with:

| Role | Authority | Cannot Do |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Human (Director) | Decides WHAT | Micromanage HOW |
| AI (Architect/Commander) | Recommends HOW | Change WHAT |

This contract is absolute. Violations trigger HALT.

---

## Chapter 3: Mode Discipline

### DECISION Mode

Open exploration. You and AI are figuring things out.

- Brainstorm freely
- Explore options
- Document decisions as D-001, D-002, etc.
- Nothing executes until approved

**Enter with:** `ENTER DECISION MODE`

### EXECUTION Mode

Frozen decisions. AI implements exactly what was specified.

- No new features
- No scope changes
- Step-by-step implementation
- Confirm each step

**Enter with:** `ENTER EXECUTION MODE`

### The Discipline

Never mix modes. If you're executing and realize you need to change something:

1. Say `HALT`
2. Say `ENTER DECISION MODE`
3. Make the change
4. Document the new decision
5. Say `ENTER EXECUTION MODE`
6. Continue

Yes, this feels slow. But "just quickly changing" something during execution is how projects fail.

---

## Chapter 4: HALT Conditions

### When HALT Triggers

| Condition | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Ambiguous requirement | Can't proceed without clarity |
| Missing specification | Can't build what's not defined |
| Unexpected error | Plan diverged from reality |
| Three failures | Escalation needed |
| You say HALT | You're the Director |

### What Happens at HALT

1. All work stops immediately
2. AI documents what triggered HALT
3. AI waits for your direction
4. No workarounds, no guessing

### Embracing HALT

HALT is not failure. HALT is the system working correctly. Every HALT caught a problem before it compounded.

The cost of a HALT is minutes. The cost of building on ambiguity is hours or days.

---

## Chapter 5: Session Continuity

### The HANDOFF Protocol

Every session ends with a HANDOFF—a complete snapshot of project state.

**HANDOFF contains:**
- Current mode
- All decisions made (with status)
- Work completed
- Work pending
- Next priorities

### Generating HANDOFF

At session end, say: `HANDOFF`

AI generates a structured document. Save it locally.

### Continuing Sessions

At session start, paste your HANDOFF and say: `CONTINUE`

AI reconstructs context and picks up where you left off.

### The Iron Rule

**Never start a continuing session without your HANDOFF.**

Without it, AI is working blind. You'll spend the session re-explaining instead of progressing.

---

# PART 2: THE GENESIS METHOD

---

## Chapter 6: Single-File Architecture

### One Document Rules All

In Genesis, everything lives in one document until complexity demands otherwise.

This document contains:
- Project description
- Decision log
- Research findings
- Specifications
- Handoff state

### Why Single-File?

Benefits of single-file architecture:

1. **No context switching** — Everything is in one place
2. **Natural evolution** — Structure emerges from need
3. **Easy handoffs** — One document to paste
4. **Lower overhead** — No file management early on

### The Living Document

Your Genesis document evolves:

**Session 1:** Idea + initial decisions
**Session 3:** Decisions + research
**Session 5:** Research + specifications
**Session 10:** Full specifications + implementation notes

Each session adds to the same document.

### When to Split

Split your document into multiple SCOPEs when:

- It exceeds ~1,000 lines
- You have 3+ distinct components
- Components have different lifecycles
- You need to protect completed work

Until then, stay single-file.

## Chapter 7: Token Tracking & Proactive Handoffs

### The Token Problem

AI has limited context windows. Long sessions risk losing information. You could be mid-discussion and suddenly AI "forgets" earlier decisions.

### Token Tracking

Genesis variants track token usage and warn you:

| Threshold | Alert |
|-----------|-------|
| 70% | Warning: Plan for handoff soon |
| 80% | Alert: Recommend handoff now |
| 85% | Critical: Auto-generating handoff |

### Proactive Handoffs

At 85% tokens, AI automatically:

1. Announces token status
2. Generates complete HANDOFF
3. Recommends session transition

You save the HANDOFF and start fresh with full context.

### Why This Matters

Without token tracking:
- You lose important context silently
- AI starts contradicting earlier decisions
- You waste time re-establishing state

With token tracking:
- You always know when to transition
- Context is never lost
- Sessions end cleanly

---

## Chapter 8: The Metamorphosis Pattern

### From Idea to System

Genesis projects follow a natural evolution:

```
IDEA → DECISIONS → RESEARCH → SPECIFICATIONS → IMPLEMENTATION → SYSTEM
```

Each stage transforms into the next. Nothing is forced—the project tells you what it needs.

### Stage 1: Idea

You start with:
- A one-paragraph description
- Basic goals
- Maybe some constraints

AI helps by:
- Asking clarifying questions
- Identifying ambiguities
- Proposing initial structure

### Stage 2: Decisions

From discussion, decisions emerge:
- D-001: We'll use approach X
- D-002: Feature Y is out of scope
- D-003: Priority is Z

Each decision is documented and numbered.

### Stage 3: Research

Some decisions need investigation:
- What technologies exist?
- What are the tradeoffs?
- What have others done?

Research findings are documented. They inform specifications.

### Stage 4: Specifications

Decisions + research = specifications:
- Detailed requirements
- Technical approach
- Acceptance criteria
- Implementation order

### Stage 5: Implementation

With clear specifications, execution is straightforward:
- Follow the spec exactly
- Report progress
- HALT if anything's unclear

### Stage 6: System

When specifications equal reality, you have a system:
- Working software
- Complete documentation
- Ready for use or iteration

### The Beauty of Metamorphosis

You never plan the whole journey upfront. Each stage naturally leads to the next. Your project evolves organically, always documented, never chaotic.

## Chapter 9: Case Study: From Napkin Sketch to Production

### The Idea

> "I want an app that helps me track my daily water intake with reminders."

That's it. One sentence. Let's watch it metamorphose.

### Session 1: Initial Exploration

**You:** [Paste Genesis governance] My idea: An app that helps track daily water intake with reminders.

**AI:** Acknowledged. Genesis mode active. Let me understand your vision:
- Is this mobile, web, or desktop?
- What's your target user?
- Any specific features beyond tracking and reminders?

**You:** Mobile, for myself initially. Track glasses of water, remind me if I haven't logged in 2 hours.

**AI:** Documented. Initial decisions:
- D-001: Mobile app (iOS/Android) — APPROVED?
- D-002: Track water by glasses — APPROVED?
- D-003: Reminder after 2hr inactivity — APPROVED?

**You:** APPROVED all.

**AI:** HANDOFF generated. Three decisions logged.

### Session 2: Research

**You:** CONTINUE [paste HANDOFF]

**AI:** Resuming. You have 3 approved decisions. Next: research implementation options. Should I investigate?

**You:** Yes

**AI:** Research findings:
1. Native (Swift/Kotlin) — Best performance, highest effort
2. React Native — Cross-platform, JavaScript
3. Flutter — Cross-platform, Dart
4. No-code tools — Fastest, limited customization

Recommendation for solo developer: React Native (balance of speed and flexibility).

**You:** APPROVED. Let's use React Native.

**AI:** D-004: React Native for implementation. HANDOFF updated.

### Session 3: Specification

**You:** CONTINUE [paste HANDOFF]

**AI:** Resuming. Ready to specify features. Starting with tracking?

**You:** Yes

**AI:** SCOPE: TRACKING
- User can log water intake (1 glass = 8oz)
- Daily total displayed on home screen
- History viewable by day/week
- Data stored locally on device

APPROVED?

**You:** Add monthly view too. Then APPROVED.

**AI:** Updated. D-005: Monthly history view. SCOPE: TRACKING specified. Ready for REMINDERS scope?

### Sessions 4-6: More Specifications

The pattern continues. Each session builds on the last. By session 6:
- SCOPE: TRACKING — SPECIFIED
- SCOPE: REMINDERS — SPECIFIED
- SCOPE: UI — SPECIFIED

### Sessions 7-12: Implementation

**You:** ENTER EXECUTION MODE. Start with TRACKING.

**AI:** Executing SCOPE: TRACKING. Step 1: Create data model. Proceeding?

**You:** APPROVED

[Implementation proceeds step by step]

### Session 13: Production

All scopes complete. App works. Documentation exists. From napkin sketch to production in 13 sessions.

## Chapter 10: Scaling Beyond Genesis

### When to Graduate

Genesis is perfect for starting projects. But eventually, complexity demands more structure.

Graduate from Genesis when:

- Your document exceeds 1,500 lines
- You have 5+ distinct components
- Multiple people will work on the project
- You need formal change management

### The Transition

Moving from Genesis to full AIXORD:

1. Split your document into proper SCOPEs
2. Create a MASTER_SCOPE for overall vision
3. Establish STATE.json for formal tracking
4. Use full mode discipline

### What Carries Over

Everything you built in Genesis transfers:
- All decisions (renumbered per scope)
- All specifications
- All research findings
- Your momentum

### The Continuous Cycle

Many projects cycle back to Genesis-style work when adding new features. The pattern is:

1. Genesis: New idea → specified
2. Full AIXORD: Complex implementation
3. Genesis: Next feature exploration
4. Full AIXORD: Integration

Use the right tool for each stage.
